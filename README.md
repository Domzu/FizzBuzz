This is one of my coding exercise and the beginning of my Python journey

FizzBuzz!
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Goodluck and havefun coding! :D
